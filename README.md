DataMiner is a Python-based project for scraping and extracting data from websites. This tool allows users to fetch structured information (e.g., headlines, product details, etc.) from targeted websites and save it in formats such as CSV or databases. Built using BeautifulSoup and Requests, it is intended for data analysis, automation, and general-purpose web scraping.
